# Final balance

In this section, I will present the details about the time I estimated before
starting the `assessment-1` and what I really invested during the whole journey.

The data are presented in a tabular format.

|Time|Study - Analysis (h)|Design - Implementation - Documentation (h)|
|:---|:------------------:|:--------------------------:|
|Estimated|10|30|
|Done|20|30|

*Note*: the data attached in the previous table has not be interpreted in
  a waterflow manner. The ammount of time relates to a quota fixed for a specific
  set of activities. Indeed, I invested the time working in an iterative
  and incremental way.

What I mean by iterative and incremental: by iterating on the same thing I refined
continuously the sub solution of the main assessment, from raw solution to a finer
one; on the other side, incrementantions describe how I progressed in time to
complete the hole assessment. Incrementing helped me to manage the backlog of tasks.

In this way, all the iterations had some time allocated for Study and Analysis, and
some other time for making the hands dirty.

Also, some time was spent in troubleshooting the integration issues; this required
some more analysis and deep study for understanding the cause.
